Assignment: Exploring Cost Management and Billing on Azure and GCP



# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to the cost management and billing interfaces of Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By the end of this assignment, you will be able to navigate these platforms to understand how cloud costs are tracked and managed.

# Instructions
## 1. Explore the Cost Management Dashboards
Azure:
Navigate to the Azure Cost Management and Billing service.
Take a tour of the dashboard to familiarize yourself with the available tools and reports.
Identify where you would monitor costs and set budgets or alerts.
GCP:
Access the Google Cloud Console and go to the Billing section.
Explore the Billing Overview and Reports sections to understand how GCP presents cost data.
## 2. Set Up a Hypothetical Budget
Azure:
Create a budget for a hypothetical monthly spend (e.g., $8).
Set up a notification to alert you when your hypothetical spending reaches 80% of the budget.
GCP:
Create a budget in GCP for the same hypothetical amount ($8).
Set up a notification to alert you when your costs approach the budget limit.
## 3. Investigate Cost Management Features
Azure:
Review the available options for forecasting future costs based on your budget.
Explore the cost-saving recommendations provided by Azure Advisor (even if no data is present, you can see where these recommendations would appear).
GCP:
Explore the "Cost Breakdown" and "Budgets & alerts" features to see how GCP allows you to track and manage your costs.
Investigate the "Recommendations" section under GCP Billing to understand potential cost-saving suggestions (if any are provided based on the budget).
## 4. Submit Your Work
Create a Markdown document summarizing your exploration of the cost management features in both Azure and GCP.
Include the following in your document:
Screenshots of the dashboards you explored.
Screenshots showing the setup of your hypothetical budgets and alerts.
A brief explanation of the cost management features you found most interesting or useful.
Commit and push this Markdown document, along with the screenshots, to your GitHub repository.
